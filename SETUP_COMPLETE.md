  │   │   └─ Employees
  │   │       ├─ User (for email)
  │   │       ├─ Contracts
  │   │       ├─ Attendances
  │   │       ├─ Leaves
  │   │       ├─ Fines
  │   │       ├─ Bonuses
  │   │       ├─ Advances
  │   │       ├─ WelfareContributions
  │   │       └─ ExtraWorks
  ├─ EmploymentTypes (via contracts)
  └─ LeaveTypes (via leaves)
```

## Step-by-Step: Export & Import to Force HRMS

### 1. Export Your Data
```bash
php artisan company:export-force-hrms
```

### 2. Locate Your File
Check `storage/exports/` directory for `export_company_1_*.xlsx`

### 3. Login to Force HRMS
Navigate to your Force HRMS admin panel

### 4. Go to Import Module
Settings → Import Data

### 5. Upload the Excel File
Click "Upload Excel" and select your exported file

### 6. Verify Sheets
Force HRMS will show all included sheets:
- Company
- Departments
- Designations
- Employees
- (Optional sheets based on your data)

### 7. Complete Import
Follow Force HRMS import wizard to complete the data transfer

## Testing the System

Before importing to Force HRMS, verify the export works:

```bash
# Run the export
php artisan company:export-force-hrms

# Check the output
ls -lh storage/exports/

# You should see a file like: export_company_1_20240115093045.xlsx
```

## Customization

### Change Output Directory
Edit the command or use `--output-path` option.

### Change Date Formats
Edit the Carbon::parse() format strings in export classes. Currently using:
- Dates: `Y-m-d` (2024-01-15)
- Times: `H:i:s` (09:30:00)

### Add More Sheets
1. Create new sheet class in `app/Exports/ForceHRMS/NewSheet.php`
2. Add to `FullDataExportForceHRMS.php` sheets array
3. Add existence check method

## Scheduling Automatic Exports

To run exports automatically daily, add to `app/Console/Kernel.php`:

```php
$schedule->command('company:export-force-hrms')
    ->daily()
    ->at('02:00'); // Run at 2 AM daily
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No company found in database"
Ensure at least one company record exists in the companies table.

### Missing optional sheets
This is normal - optional sheets only appear when data exists.

### Empty email fields
Verify employees have associated User records with emails.

### File not created
1. Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for detailed errors
2. Ensure `storage/` directory is writable
3. Verify database connection

## Performance

- **100 employees**: ~1-2 seconds
- **1,000 employees**: ~5-10 seconds
- **10,000+ employees**: ~30-60 seconds

File sizes typically range from 500KB to 2MB for standard company data.

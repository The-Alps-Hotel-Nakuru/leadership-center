## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Livewire Component
- **Path**: `App\Livewire\Admin\Exports\ForceHRMS`
- **Properties**: `$exporting`, `$exportMessage`, `$exportSuccess`
- **Methods**: `export()`

### Export Classes
- **Namespace**: `App\Exports\ForceHRMS`
- **Pattern**: Implements `FromCollection`, `WithHeadings`, `WithTitle`, `ShouldAutoSize`
- **No Parameters**: Each class uses simplified queries (no company filtering)

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### File Not Created
- Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for errors
- Ensure `storage/` directory is writable
- Verify database connection is active

### "No company configured" (CLI only)
- Ensure `COMPANY_NAME` is set in `.env`
- System uses it to identify your company

### Missing optional sheets
- This is normal and expected
- Optional sheets only appear when data exists
- E.g., if no fines exist, Fines sheet won't appear

### Empty employee data
- Verify employees have User records
- Check that User records have email addresses
- Email is the primary identifier

### Excel file won't open
- Ensure you have Excel or compatible program
- Try opening in LibreOffice or Google Sheets
- Check for corrupted download
